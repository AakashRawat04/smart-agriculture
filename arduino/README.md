## DHT 11- Humidity and Temperature Sensor

![DHT-11](https://github.com/anish-patil/smart-agriculture/assets/101693650/7ddc9968-86d2-4c87-93ff-fb682560ff71)

The DHT11 is a basic and inexpensive digital temperature and humidity sensor. It is widely used in various applications, especially in the field of electronics and microcontroller-based projects. Here are some key characteristics and information about the DHT11 sensor:

1. It provides temperature readings with a resolution of 1°C and humidity readings with a resolution of 1% RH (Relative Humidity).

2. The sensor's temperature measurement range is from 0°C to 50°C (32°F to 122°F). The humidity measurement range is from 20% to 90% RH.

3. It provides a temperature accuracy of ±2°C and a humidity accuracy of ±5% RH.

4. The sensor communicates with microcontrollers or other digital devices using a digital signal. It utilizes a single-wire communication protocol, which makes it relatively simple to interface with microcontrollers like Arduino.
